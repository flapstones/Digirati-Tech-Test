# David Johnson Digirati Tech Test

I have used 'react-a11y-dropdown' to make the dropdowns fully keyboard accessible.

First of all download the code and cd into the project folder and then run

### `npm install`

You can then run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
